This is a minimal working version of the COBAYN approach. It is a Matlab project that predicts the 
best set of compiler flags given a new unseen application. There are three different ready-to-go dataset have been provided in the COBAYN/data directory.

# USAGE:

A quick automated script that takes the db, does the import, train and prediction 
is available by just running:
```
>>cd COBAYN
>>COBAYN.m
```

## Step-by-step Process
Modify the "take_db.m" file located at ./dataProcessing/take_db.m
based on you need as you have to mention the following:
```
1- Importing files:
    - Exploration Data set
    - Application characterization file
2- Dimension Reduction Technique
    - Default is PCA
3- Dataset Normalization Technique
    - pick 1-5 and comment it out
4- Training COBAYN
5- Predicting using COBAYN
```

### 1- Importing the files 

*Exploration Data set:
Your input dataset.csv must be a N columns csv file and 
conformed to the following structure:
```
FIRST_ROW     = Header
COL#{1}       = APP_NAME
COL#{2:M}     = COMPILER_FLAGS (binary (categorical) flags: 0 _or_ 1)
COL#{M+1:N-1} = EXEC_TIME per each datasets (Numbers)
COL#{N}       = CODE_SIZE
```
 
* Appliction characterization

You application characterization.csv set must be n columns csv and have 
the following structure:
```
FIRST_ROW     = Header
COL#{1}       = APP_NAME (i.e. automatic_bitcount)
COL#{2}       = DATA_SET_No (i.e: dataset1)
COL#{3:n}     = FEATURES (Number)
```
- Training the BN:
  In order to train the COBAYN BN network, you should follow these steps:
  >>init_MatEnv.m // setup the paths  
  >>take_db.m  // imports the dataset
  >>generateModels.m  // trains COBAYN

##  4- Testing the BN (Inference)
```
-- Cross-validation Mode
   >>predictionTableGenerator.m  // predicts per application and generates --> COBAYN structure

-- Standalone Test 
   Not available in the current project.
```

#### Original Bayesian network package in Matlab: 

The Bayesian network package is dervided from the work of "MATEDA-2.0":
